- Use `uv` for all Python dependency management and execution (no pip/poetry).
- Preferred commands:
	- `uv sync` to install dependencies (creates .venv).
	- `uv run pytest` for tests (or `make test`).
	- `uv run ruff check .` / `uv run ruff format .` for lint/format.
	- `uv run mypy src` for type checking.
- Use `async with NationalGridClient(...)` for session management; avoid manual `close()` unless necessary.
- Preserve the multi-endpoint GraphQL routing pattern: each request targets its specific endpoint.
- Keep GraphQL request building via `StandardQuery` and `compose_query()` helpers.
- Authentication is required for production usage; do not bypass OIDC flow in library code.
- All GraphQL calls must include the `ocp-apim-subscription-key` header from config.
- Maintain the frozen `NationalGridConfig` API (`from_env`, `build_headers`, `with_overrides`).
- Tests should mock `aiohttp.ClientSession` and `NationalGridAuth.async_login` as in existing patterns.
- Use `pytest-asyncio` for async tests; keep tests in `tests/`.
- Keep communication concise and focused; follow development best practices.
